# What is Devops ?
- By the name DevOps, it’s very clear that it’s a collaboration of **Development** as well as **Operations**. But one
should know that DevOps is not a tool, or a software or framework, DevOps is a Combination of Tools which helps for the automation of whole infrastructure.
- DevOps is basically and implementation of **Agile methodology** on Development side as well as Operations
side.
- In Simple words , Devops is the culture, set of practices amd working methodology that help organization develop, test , deploy and maintain softwares faster and more efficiently.
- It emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation to increase the speed and quality of software delivery and reduce time of deployment
- in simple word,  It is just a practice or methodology which helps in  developement , building , testing and deployment of software with the aim of improving the speed and reliability of software by automating processes, increasing collaboration, and leveraging tools and technologies that support continuous integration, testing, and deployment

- Devops is bringing develoment and operations teams together and empoworing them to work more closily and efficiently , 


# Key Concepts
- To properly understand DevOps, it is important to be aware of the following core concepts: CI/CD, Infrastructure as code, Automation, Collaboration and Monitoring.

- 1. ) **Continuos integration**:Think of continuous integration as a nonstop party for your code. Whenever a new code change is made, it gets integrated into the main codebase(main/master branch) — just like a new guest arriving at a party. By integrating code changes regularly, teams can catch any problems early and keep the party going smoothly.

- 2. ) **Continuous delivery**: Continuous delivery is like a well-oiled machine — it’s designed to keep software rolling out smoothly and efficiently. With continuous delivery, teams can deploy new code changes to production at any time, as long as they pass automated tests and meet other pre-defined criteria. It’s like a conveyor belt for code, moving smoothly and steadily from development to production
- 3. ) **Infrastructure as code**:Imagine if you could control your entire infrastructure — servers, networks, storage, and more — just by writing a few lines of code. That’s the power of infrastructure as code. By treating infrastructure as code, teams can automate the provisioning and management of their systems, making it easier to scale and improve reliability
- 4. ) **Automation**: Automation is like having a team of robots working for you. By using tools and processes to automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, teams can save time and effort, and focus on more important tasks.

- 5. ) **Monitoring**: Monitoring is like a watchful eye that keeps track of the health and performance of your systems, applications, and infrastructure. It’s like having a team of superheroes constantly scanning the horizon for any signs of trouble, and swooping in to fix problems before they can cause harm.



# Why use Devops ?
In today's world every companies from startups to big giants , Everyone is using Devops. Here is the few main reasons of being so much  loved with devops:
- 1 **Improved efficiency(quality of being efficient) and speed**: DevOps is like a turbo boost for your software development process. By automating tasks and streamlining processes, it can help teams work more efficiently and accelerate the delivery of new features and updates.


# List of Devops tools
- **Jenkins**:Jenkins is like a personal assistant for your software development process. It can automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code, saving you time and effort.

- **Ansible**: Ansible is a tool that helps you manage and automate tasks on your computer and other machines. You can use it to install software, change settings, and do other things on multiple machines at once, without having to manually log in to each one. It’s like having a team of helpers that you can control from a single place, making it easier to manage your computer systems and infrastructure.
- **Docker**: Docker is like a magical suitcase for your code. It allows you to package your code and all its dependencies into a portable container, making it easy to deploy and run your applications anywhere
- **Git**: Git is like a time machine for your code. It allows you to track and revert changes to your codebase, making it easier to collaborate and manage your software development process.
- **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is like a traffic controller for your containers. It helps you manage and orchestrate a large number of Docker containers, making it easier to scale and deploy your applications.
- **Nagios**: Nagios is like a watchdog for your systems. It continuously monitors the performance and availability of your systems and alerts you when issues arise, helping you identify and resolve problems before they impact your users.



# Who are  Development teams ?
the development team is responsible for writing and testing code. Some common roles that may be included in a development team include software developers, quality assurance engineers, and technical writers


# Who are Operations teams ?
The operations team is responsible for deploying and maintaining the software that the development team has written. They are responsible for the infrastructure that the software runs on, and for ensuring that the software is running smoothly and efficiently.
common roles that may be included in an operations team include system administrators, network engineers, and site reliability engineers
