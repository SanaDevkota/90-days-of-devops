# DevSecoops
Devsecops is the software developement approach that aims to bring together development, security ,and operations teams to build and maintain security secure software applications. It is based on the principles of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, which aim to deliver software updates and features more quickly and frequently. In DevSecOps, security is an integral part of the software development process, rather than an afterthought. This means that security testing, monitoring, and other security measures are built into the software development life cycle (SDLC) from the beginning, rather than being added later. DevSecOps aims to improve collaboration and communication between development, security, and operations teams, to create a more efficient and effective software development process


# Devops vs DevSecOps

Devops brings development and operations teams together, whereas it brings devops with security teams group together.
In simple words , DevosecOps extends devops and include security in it which includes security from the beggining and make focus in it .



# **Secure Coding** Overview
Secure coding, also referred to as secure programming, involves writing code in a high-level language that follows strict principles, with the goal of preventing potential vulnerabilities (which could expose data or cause harm within a targeted system).Secure coding is more than just writing, compiling, and releasing code into applications. Secure coding is the practice of writing software in a way that ensures the security of the system and the data it processes. It involves designing, coding, and testing software with security in mind to prevent vulnerabilities and protect against potential attacks .

There are several **key principles** of secure coding that developers should follow:

1. Input validation: It is important to validate all user input to ensure that it is in the expected format and does not contain any malicious code or unexpected characters. This can be achieved through the use of regular expressions, data type checks, and other validation techniques.

2. Output encoding: Output data should be properly encoded to prevent any potential injection attacks. For example, HTML output should be properly escaped to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and SQL queries should be parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.

3. Access control: Access control involves restricting access to resources or data to only those users who are authorized to access them. This can include implementing authentication and authorization protocols, as well as enforcing least privilege principles to ensure that users have only the access rights they need to perform their job duties.

4. Error handling: Error handling is the process of properly handling errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program. This can include logging errors, displaying appropriate messages to users, and mitigating the impact of errors on system security.
5. Cryptography: Cryptography should be used to protect sensitive data and communications, such as passwords, financial transactions, and sensitive documents. This can be achieved through the use of encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.
6. Secure architecture: Secure architecture is the foundation of a secure system. This includes designing systems with security in mind, using secure frameworks and libraries, and following secure design patterns.


There are several tools and techniques that can be used to help ensure that code is secure, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and Secure Code Review. 


1. Secure Code Reviews: Secure Code Review is a process of reviewing software code with the goal of identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities. It is typically performed by a team of security experts who are familiar with common coding practices and security best practices. Secure Code Review can be done manually or with the use of automated tools, and may involve a combination of SAST and SCA techniques.



In summary, Overall, secure coding is a crucial practice that helps protect software and its users from security vulnerabilities and attacks.
