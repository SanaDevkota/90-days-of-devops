I was given a task to do some works on basic linux commands. So i have successfully completed it ,
- Check your current directory
  - To check the current directory we use the command `pwd`
- List all the files in the current directory including hidden files
  - To list all the files in the current directory including hidden files then we can use the command `ls -a`
- Create nested directories
  - To create nested directories we can use the command `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3` . Note `-p` is used to create nested directories.
